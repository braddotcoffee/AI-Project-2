# AI-Project-2
Implement an agent using the minimax algorithm capable of playing Gomoku 

Our beautiful creation is named `golem`

Call `python golem.py` to start the agent
Written in `python3`

Our beautiful creation has `hands` to interact with the rest of the world,
a `brain` to make decisions, a `frontal_lobe`, and a `body` to act as the 
link between them all.

It uses a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and a heuristic/evaluation function to evaluate
intermediate board states. We only look at spots on the board that are adjacent to another piece on
the board.
